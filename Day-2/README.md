The `WHERE` clause filters records based on conditions, returning only rows that meet your criteria.  
It’s one of the most important SQL clauses for extracting meaningful insights from data.


Operators:

Comparison: =, !=, <>, >, <, >=, <=
Logical: AND, OR, NOT
Pattern Matching: LIKE, IN, BETWEEN

### **Basic Syntax:**
```sql
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;
```
